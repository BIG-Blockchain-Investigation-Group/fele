>fele chaincode register create -nn "Gateway" -cn "uhcl" -ccn "mbse" -p /user/channel/chaincode/mbse

execute 

Tn Preethi's computer, development of project x (Gateway) using a channel y (uhcl).

Target the Fabric network gateway and channel uhcl.

/user/exp/xy:

three chaincodes to be stored in folders with the same names.
[1] mbse
[2] abac_exp
[3] testfele

Execute to register mbse :

fele chaincode register create -nn "Gateway" -cn "uhcl" -ccn "mbse" -p /user/exp/xy/mbse

One action:
[A1] Copying the folder /user/exp/xy/mbse in Preethi's computer
to the folder fele/chaincode/Gateway/uhcl/mbse folder.
[A1.1] fele/chaincode should be created when initializing fele.
[A1.2] fele/chaincode/Gateway may (should?) be created when the network Gateway is created.
[A1.3] fele/chaincode/Gateway/uhcl may (should?) be created when the channel uhcl is created.
[A1.4] If fele/chaincode/Gateway/uhcl/mbse does not exist,
			Copy /user/exp/xy/mbse in the caller's computer to become fele/chaincode/Gateway/uhcl/mbse in the fele computer.
		else  // update/register existin chaincode.
			Copy /user/exp/xy/mbse in the caller's computer to replace fele/chaincode/Gateway/uhcl/mbse in the fele computer.
			In the future, may stores copies for studying chaincode lifecycle.
				E.g. fele/pastChaincode/Gateway/uhcl/mbse/v1 (etc.)
